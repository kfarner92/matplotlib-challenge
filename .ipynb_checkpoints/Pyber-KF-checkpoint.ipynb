    "The ride sharing bonanza continues! Seeing the success of notable players like Uber and Lyft, you've decided to join a fledgling ride sharing company of your own. In your latest capacity, you'll be acting as Chief Data Strategist for the company. In this role, you'll be expected to offer data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation.\n",

    "As final considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You must use the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "* You must use the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.\n",
    "* You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.\n",
    "* You must use proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles, Axes Labels, Legend Labels, Wedge Percentages, and Wedge Labels.\n",
    "* Remember when making your plots to consider aesthetics!\n",
    "  * You must stick to the Pyber color scheme (Gold, Light Sky Blue, and Light Coral) in producing your plot and pie charts.\n",
    "  * When making your Bubble Plot, experiment with effects like `alpha`, `edgecolor`, and `linewidths`.\n",
    "  * When making your Pie Chart, experiment with effects like `shadow`, `startangle`, and `explosion`.\n",
    "* You must include an exported markdown version of your Notebook called  `README.md` in your GitHub repository.\n",
