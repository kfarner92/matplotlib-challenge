Pyber Homework Kristian Farner Analysis:

1)  When you look at the bubble chart you can see that there is a trend for fares to be higher 
    when there are less drivers on the road. This would make sense because if the supply of drivers
    is low then the price demanded for a ride should increase.

2)  If you compare the total drivers pie chart to the total fares pie chart you can see that suburban 
    riders are on average paying more per ride than urban riders. There are more than four times
    the amount of urban drivers but their total fares are only greater than suburban by double.

3)  Overall this data shows that the company should be focused primarily on our suburban and urban markets. 
    although rural areas are higher priced fares the total fares only account for 5% of the total.
